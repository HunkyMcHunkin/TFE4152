# TFE4152 Project
In the course TFE4152, Design of integrated circuits, we have been tasked to design a four pixel digital camera in a 2x2 matrix.
In this project we are designing and implementing the analog and digital control blocks for the digital camera. This includes the *Readout and control* and *Pixel electronics* blocks in the diagram given below.
